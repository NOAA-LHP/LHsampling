# LHsampling
Strategies and approaches selecting biological samples for fisheries life history.
See Schemmel E., Bohaboy E., Kinney M., O'Malley J. An assessment of sampling strategies for estimating fish growth from fishery-dependent samples. In prep.

Provided is the individual-based-mortality population simulation model (IBM) and the life history sampling function. The life history sampling function uses a von Bertalanaffy growth model and provides growth paramters and length-at-age estimates and CV for proportional otolith sampling or fixed otolith sampling.
